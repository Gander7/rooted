## Games

### [[Duck Duck Goose#Duck, Duck, Dodge]] with Multiple Games

Start with at least two games of Duck Duck Dodge going on. 

Just like Duck, Duck, Goose except when the person that is "it" calls Goose and tags the "goose" on the head, the "goose" then goes to the middle of the circle where a dodgeball waits. They have to stay in the circle and have one chance to hit the person that's "it" with the dodgeball. 

- If "it" is HIT with the dodgeball then "it" goes to the other game of Duck Duck Dodge. This will enable people bouncing back and forth between games. The "goose" becomes "it".
- If "it" is NOT hit by the ball, "it" sits down and the "goose" goes to the other game.

### [[Clusters]]

Requires nothing.

Have the group mill around and then call out a number. People have 30 seconds to find a group of that number. If you call out 3, then groups of 2 or 4 will be eliminated. Groups can steal a person from another group, or defend itself against an interloper who would attach and disqualify all of them.

The amount of time can be decreased to make it more stressful.
