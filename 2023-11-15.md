## Games

### Four Corners

Four teams, one in each corner. Leader calls out a number or name of a team and the team they are attacking. The attacking team runs to the defending team and tries to pull members of the defending team back to the attacking teams corner. After about 30secs, yell STOP or RESET to put everyone back in their corners. If a person was pulled all the way back to the attacking teams corner, they are now part of that team.

### Electricity

Two teams line up back to back in chairs. The 4 people at the ends are the only ones facing each other. At one end, have a water bucket and a cup. At the other end a coin, coin app, or some other random decision making. All youth should hole hands with the people in their line creating a link from youth with the coin-tosser to youth by the water.

With larger groups, you can have the coin at the middle and two water+cups at either end. In this version, there are 8 youth facing each other since it's just two games of it that share a coin tosser.

Everyone closes their eyes except leaders and youth right beside the coin tosser. The coin is flipped and continously flipped until it lands on heads. At that point the youth squeeze the hands of the next youth and create a race of hand squeezing until they get to the water. First youth to put their hand up gets handed a cup with some water in it to throw at their opponent.

Everyone moves down, water tossers become coin watchers.

### Dodgeball

It'sa dodgeball. Play regularly or doctor.
Be clear on what happens if you catch the ball and watch out for cheaters, some youth really like to cheat at this.

### Positive Reinforcement

Send one youth out of the room. Think of two or three weird, funny, or mundane things for them to do, like stand on a chair and bow. Let them in and cheer for them when they move in a direction or action that would complete the predetermined actions.
