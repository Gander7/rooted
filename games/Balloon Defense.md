Requires 25-50 balloons of two colors (i.e. 20 red and 20 blue)

Form two teams of elves. Each team must defend its treasure (a pile of balloons) while attempting to steal or destroy the other team's treasure. Use one color of balloons for one team, and another color for the other team. Designate a time period (five to 10 minutes) to play the game. When the time ends, each team's un-popped balloons count 100 points each. Stolen, un-popped balloons count 200 points each.

Encore (Elf Defense):

This is a simple game that tests kids ability to think fast. Divide into teams. Yell out a word that is commonly found in songs (love, road, river, girl, baby, need). The teams must sing a song in unison (together) using that word. The first team to do it wins 50 points.
