Divide into 4 teams. Send each team into a corner. The object of the game is to see which team can get to the opposite (diagonal) corner the fastest using the designated method that the leader calls out (eg. if the leader calls out "hopping," the teams must hop to the opposite corner). This will create quite a "bottleneck" or "traffic jam" in the middle each time. Keep score of which team wins each crossing. First team to 5 wins. No points unless everyone does it.

Methods:
- Hopping
- Wheel barrel (one person holding a partner's legs while they walk on hands)
- Crab Walk
- Sprint
- Backwards Walk
- Skipping
- Crawling
