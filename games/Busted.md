Requires:
- 10 balloons per team(same color)  
- about 10 ping pong balls per team

With the ping pong balls, you will write letters on them that spell out a word for each team(a letter per ball). Use wet-erase markers so the balls can be reused and the letters won't come off during the game. Long simple words are best so Team 1 may have Baseball and Team 2 may have Dinosaur.

Blow up the 10 balloons for each team, putting a single ping pong ball in each for that team, some balloons will not have ping pong balls. So Team 1 will have 10 balloons but only 8 of them will have balls in them which would spell out Baseball.

Put all the balloons in the middle and mix them up(maybe in a kiddie pool so they don't go anywhere). Scatter the teams so that each team is the same distance away. Have the teams line up in an order, this is a relay race. The balloons could be in another room or even upstairs to make a longer run.

When you say go, the teams will send one youth to the middle to get a balloon of their team's colour and when they get back the next person can go. As the team gets balloons, they will pop them to find ping pong balls. The team that correctly spells out the word first wins.
