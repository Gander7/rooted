Requires chairs, a coin, a few plastic/foam cups, and a jug of water of two.

Two teams line up back to back in chairs. The 4 people at the ends are the only ones facing each other. At one end, have a water bucket and a cup. At the other end a coin, coin app, or some other random decision making. All youth should hole hands with the people in their line creating a link from youth with the coin-tosser to youth by the water.

With larger groups, you can have the coin at the middle and two water+cups at either end. In this version, there are 8 youth facing each other since it's just two games of it that share a coin tosser.

Everyone closes their eyes except leaders and youth right beside the coin tosser. The coin is flipped and continously flipped until it lands on heads. At that point the youth squeeze the hands of the next youth and create a race of hand squeezing until they get to the water. First youth to put their hand up gets handed a cup with some water in it to throw at their opponent.

Everyone moves down, water tossers become coin watchers.

## Variations

Instead of raising your hand and getting a cup of water at the end, put a bucket of water with a bar of soap in it. First person to get it gets to rotate their team and go to the front. The other person stays and has to try to get it again.
