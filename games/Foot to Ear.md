Requires nothing.

Have everyone get into pairs. one partner in a circle, the other partners in a circle inside the first circle. Two concentric circles.

Start some music and have one circle move one way and the other circle move the other way. When the music stops, call out two body parts such as "Foot to Ear". The partners need to find each other and put those designated body parts together. Think about the parts you'll use. Don't call out "chest to head".
