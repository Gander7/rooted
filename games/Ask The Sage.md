Requires some "sages", a pencil/pen and a sheet with questions on them for each youth.

Prepare a sheet for each youth that has questions that only a "Sage" would be able to answer. They can be fun, silly, serious or related to your talk. Each Sage should have the answer to only one or two questions.

Ask several volunteers to agree to be "Wise Sages" for the evening. Ask them to dress up (optional) and wait in several different rooms in your facility. The farther apart the Sages are the better. 

Give out your question sheet and a pen to each youth. They must look for the Sages throughout the building. They are allowed to open the door and check to see if a Sage is there. If there is, they must close
the door and petition the Sage to grant him or her an audience. They do this by saying these exact words..."OH GREAT WISE SAGE, MAY I ENTER?" If they mess up this phrase, the Sage will tell them to
come back later. Youth must go from Sage to Sage and cannot go to the same Sage twice in a row.

If the youth gains an audience with a sage, they may ask a question, but once again, they must use the correct phrase..."OH GREAT WISE SAGE...(And then the Question)". If they fail to say the correct phrase,
the Sage would say something like this..."You have not asked correctly". If the question is phrased correctly, then the Sage may answer. If the Sage does not know the answer to THAT question, the Sage should say something like... "I truly do not know". In that case, the youth should make note not to ask that Sage the
same question again.

If the question is asked correctly, and the Sage knows the answer, then the youth gets a correct answer. The first youth with all the answers wins. This game stretches youth to be very deliberate with their words.
