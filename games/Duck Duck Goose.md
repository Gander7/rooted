It's Duck Duck Goose except you have multiple circles going. 

## Variations

### Drip, Drip, Drop

Just like Duck, Duck, Goose except with a cup of water or a sponge that the person drips, drips, drips, then drops on the person they want to chase them around the circle. A sponge is probably perferable to prevent larges splashes while moving quickly unless you want that.

### Duck, Duck, Dodge

Just like Duck, Duck, Goose except when the person that is "it" calls Goose and tags the "goose" on the head, the "goose" then goes to the middle of the circle where a dodgeball waits. They have to stay in the circle and have one chance to hit the person that's "it" with the dodgeball.  Choose your resolution below on how you want to handle the next part:
#### Classic

- If "it" is hit with the dodgeball then "it" continues to be "it" and the "goose" goes back to their spot.
- If "it" is NOT hit by the ball, "it" sits down, and the "goose" is now "it"
### Multiple Games

- Start with at least two games of Duck Duck Dodge going on. 
- If "it" is HIT with the dodgeball then "it" goes to the other game of Duck Duck Dodge. This will enable people bouncing back and forth between games. The "goose" becomes "it".
- If "it" is NOT hit by the ball, "it" sits down and the "goose" goes to the other game.
