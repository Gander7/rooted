Four teams, one in each corner. Leader calls out a number or name of a team and the team they are attacking. The attacking team runs to the defending team and tries to pull members of the defending team back to the attacking teams corner. After about 30secs, yell STOP or RESET to put everyone back in their corners. If a person was pulled all the way back to the attacking teams corner, they are now part of that team.
