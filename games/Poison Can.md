Have everyone hold hands in a circle with an empty garbage can in the middle. When your ready get everyone to start walking together clockwise.

- You're out if you touch the garbage can.
- Both people are out if you break apart

You can use multiple cans or multiple games for larger groups. Even two groups, when you are out you go to the other group. With larger groups you could have 3 or 4 circles that people go between when they get out, as long as you have enough garbage cans.
